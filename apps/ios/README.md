# Crew for iOS

A native SwiftUI viewport onto the comet-native mesh. The phone is a **peer
device**: it joins the same Loro CRDT rooms as every other device (workspace
doc + per-chat session docs over the edge's Durable Objects), renders the
mirrors, and drives remote engines through the durable command queue. No
engine runs on the phone.

## Build & run

Requires Xcode 26+ (iOS 26 SDK — Liquid Glass APIs).

```sh
cd apps/ios
xcodebuild -project Comet.xcodeproj -scheme Comet \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' build
```

Or open `Comet.xcodeproj` in Xcode and run. Dependencies (SPM, resolved
automatically): [loro-swift 1.13.x](https://github.com/loro-dev/loro-swift)
(matches the engine's loro 1.13), [swift-markdown](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-markdown)
(cmark-gfm: tables/strikethrough/tasklists — the same feature set as the
desktop's pulldown-cmark config).

Production and staging use the same Swift target with separate checked-in schemes,
bundle IDs, persisted state, credentials, invite schemes, and cloud endpoints:

```sh
# Production: Crew, ai.ashler.crew, version 1.0 build 3
xcodebuild -project Comet.xcodeproj -scheme Comet \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=Crew Mobile Parity' build

# Staging: Crew Staging, ai.ashler.crew.staging, version 1.0 build 6
xcodebuild -project Comet.xcodeproj -scheme 'Crew Staging' \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=Crew Mobile Parity' build
```

| Scheme | Edge | Scaffold | Project scope | Invite scheme |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Comet` | `comet.internal.ashler.com` | `scaffold.internal.ashler.com` | `ashler-production` | `comet://` |
| `Crew Staging` | `comet-staging.internal.ashler.com` | `scaffold-staging.internal.ashler.com` | `ashler-staging` | `comet-staging://` |

Performance changes shared by both builds are documented in
[`docs/memory-plan.md`](../../docs/memory-plan.md#9-crew-0167-performance-audit-2026-09-05):
single-flight reconnects with durable resubmission, coalesced snapshot saves,
workspace-cache retention, and bounded parse-cache lifetime. Unicode numeric
highlighting always advances, and code recoloring no longer copies each token's
entire line prefix.

The 2026-09-05 release uploaded production **1.0 (3)** and staging **1.0 (2)**
to TestFlight. App Store Connect processed both and assigned them to the existing
**Ashler Internal** group. The staging tester's installation of build 2 was
confirmed; the production invitation was resent and remains awaiting acceptance.
These are internal TestFlight releases, not public App Store submissions.

Staging **1.0 (5)** adds compacted-history recovery and host-discovered harnesses.
The model picker exposes Claude Code, Codex, OMP, and Prime Agent when advertised
by the selected host, with lazy model rows and search. Catalog failures remain
visible and retryable; Scaffold retains its OMP-only launch contract.

A stale cache must not treat an import with pending dependencies as successful.
Recovery validates a fresh server snapshot, preserves recoverable offline edits,
and atomically switches the room, projection, and disk saver to the recovered
replica. Divergent offline conflicts or unsupported container changes retain the
old data and surface a synchronization error rather than silently overwriting it.
App Store Connect confirmed build 5 in **Ashler Internal** and its installation
by the existing tester on 2026-09-06.

### Staging 1.0 (6): mobile status feedback

- Session rows show unread, live status, and last-updated time independently.
  Local and shared sessions combine owner status with current-turn transcript
  activity; inferred liveness does not refresh the displayed timestamp.
- Pending sends show `Sending…` immediately. Host admission hands off to the
  processing spinner and elapsed time, including before the first response
  frame. Completion clears processing; rejected sends clear sending feedback
  and preserve the draft for retry.

Uploaded to **Ashler Internal** on 2026-09-06. App Store Connect confirmed
installation of **1.0 (6)** on the existing tester's iPhone 13 Pro. Verification
covered 19 native simulator checks, visible sending/processing/terminal states,
and a fixture-free `Release-Staging` build before the device archive and upload.

### Connecting

- **Production**: Crew discovers Scaffold's OAuth metadata, dynamically
  registers the native client, completes authorization-code + PKCE S256 in the
  system browser, validates the issued `sc_rc_` bearer, and joins the
  deployment's verified project scope.
- **Dev**: against a local `AUTH_MODE=dev` edge, launch with a user id +
  project scope; the bearer is `userId@projectScope`.
- **Demo mode**: fully offline dataset with a scripted streaming reply —
  explore the UI with no infrastructure. Launch args for screenshot rigs:
  `-demo [-route chat:<id>|space:<id>] [-stream]`.


### Session control coverage

- The home screen merges every non-archived workspace chat with the signed-in
  principal's imported session refs.
- `comet://invite/{chatId}/{sessionId}/{grantId}` links pin missing membership
  and open the session directly.
- New-session launch supports the selected desktop device or a Scaffold OMP
  environment, including source ref and database snapshot selection. Scaffold
  creation, attachment, readiness, and command admission run through the
  trusted desktop controller; the phone receives no sandbox credential.
- Existing local and Scaffold sessions accept run/steer/stop/input commands.
  Local OMP sessions with durable native context can be forked from the session
  toolbar.

                        full parses) — parser.rs port
  Highlight.swift       line tokenizer with carry state, paint-only

  TranscriptView.swift  lazy stack + stick-to-bottom (pin breaks only on user
                        scroll, 70pt re-engage band, 320pt jump button),
                        tool-group folds, error/input chips
  Veil.swift            paint-only streaming fade (EMA-tracked duration,
                        1−(1−p)^1.6 curve)

### Parity notes (desktop ⇄ mobile translations)

| Desktop | iOS |
| --- | --- |
| Sidebar: Spaces + recent Sessions | Home screen sections; unread, status, and recency remain independent |
| Horizontal session tabs per space | Space detail: recency-sorted session list |
| Tab close = archive | Swipe-to-archive |
| Composer `white_alpha(0.03)` pill + hairline | Liquid Glass pill (`glassEffect`) + hairline |
| Harness brand SVG marks (icons.rs) | Same path data via a native SVG path parser (`BrandMarks.swift`) |
| Harness/model picker popover + curated catalogs | Brand-mark cards + catalog menu + reasoning-ladder chips (`HarnessCatalog.swift`, ported from crates/harness) |
| Add-space palette (device + folder browser) | New-space sheet: device tabs + remote folder browser (ListFolders over the device-room relay, git repos badged) |
| ControlRpc over device-room relay | `DeviceRelayClient` — binary `uleb128(len)+header+payload` frames, `{"s","k","to","from"}` header, ndjson ControlRpc; used for ListFolders + direct-to-host `Mutate {createSpace}` (local doc-write fallback when the host is offline) |
| Hover timestamps / copy | Context menus |
| gpui `list()` sum-tree virtualization | `LazyVStack` + stable row ids + version fingerprints |
| Stick-to-bottom spring, wheel-up breaks pin | Scroll-phase-gated pin + spring scrollTo, same 70/320pt thresholds |

Status colors, fonts, spacing, markdown metrics, veil timing, command-ledger
shapes, and the wire protocol are ports, not approximations — constants match
the desktop sources cited in each file header.

### Writer discipline (what the phone writes)

- Workspace doc: `archived`/`title`/`lastSeenAt` and related chat metadata,
  plus principal-scoped session refs. The phone does not advertise an engine
  device row or presence heartbeat.
- Chat creation awaits the owning host's authenticated `Mutate:createChat`
  before local echo or sending.
- Ordinary-session commands use the host's `QueueCommand` admission path;
  Scaffold commands use the verified controller route. Client-minted message
  IDs connect optimistic sends to admission errors and committed transcript
  entries. The host writes transcript entries and command outcomes.
