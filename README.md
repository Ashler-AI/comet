# Zeron

Control your coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Devin, Grok, Hermes, Pi, Antigravity) locally by default, with optional multi-device sync.

## Desktop app

Download the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/zeronsh/zeron/releases/latest):

- **macOS** — `zeron-<version>-macos-arm64.dmg`
- **Windows** — `zeron-<version>-windows-x86_64-setup.exe`
- **Linux** — `zeron-<version>-linux-<arch>.tar.gz`, then run its `install.sh`

No account or network connection is needed; sessions stay on your device. The app updates itself.

## Headless (CLI)

For servers and other machines without a display, such as a VPS that keeps agents running after you close your laptop. Linux only:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://zeron.sh/install.sh | sh
zeron status
```

The installer starts the engine as a background service that survives reboots.

```bash
zeron status      # local/synced mode and engine status
zeron update      # update to the latest release
zeron daemon start|stop|restart|status
```

## Multi-device sync (optional)

Sign in to start an agent on one device and follow or drive it from another:

```bash
zeron daemon stop
zeron login        # or: zeron logout to return to local-only
zeron daemon start
```

Devices signed in to the same account can read and write each other's workspace files, so only sign in devices you trust. Existing local sessions are never uploaded.

## Crew Canary authentication

Crew Canary groups pending HTTP and WebSocket authorization checks by credential and deployment in the existing `AUTH_GRANTS` namespace. Each 200 ms rendezvous performs a fresh control-plane check; successful authorization is never cached between batches.

Temporary authority failures share a fail-closed cooldown and preserve `Retry-After`. This does not change verification quotas, credentials, account routing, or device-grant storage.

The native directory publisher retains pending jobs but stops querying an unchanged local snapshot after a server-version rejection, including across restarts. Transcript or registry progress enables a fresh lookup; server counters never become local publication evidence. Transient failures pause the worker for at least `Retry-After`.

Native inference reissues an authority at its actual expiry rather than repeatedly requesting the same still-valid grant. Renewal preserves principal and scope, remains fenced against sign-out/cancellation, and logs only authority digests, epochs, and timestamps. A short successful inference turn is not evidence of expiry or renewal.
